### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Bootstrap](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I used bootstrap to style this project and also I thought I can use bootstrap
components to advance this project easily but unfortunately I found out It was a
really bad decision now I prefer to use tailwind with React and Bootstrap with
plain javascript .

### Continued development

This project is not completed and these tasks should to be added:

- A light box for when user clicks on product image
- Hover state for thumbnails
- Adding to cart function
- Cart should be update as user add or delete products of it
- Nav menu needs to be responsive as the design

I might take a look to project in future and complete it!
